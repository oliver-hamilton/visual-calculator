# Overview

Given the number of native desktop calculators lacking a dedicated fractions button, support for displaying fractions and surds naturally, and a complete editable history, I decided to create an app supporting all three features. Despite the excellent offerings on mobile and on the web, sometimes I felt in need of a native desktop calculator that functioned similarly to a physical scientific calculator. It is this role that Visual Calculator fulfils, and I hope that it will prove useful for students, academics, and PC users alike.

# Installation

*Update:* Unfortunately, Visual Calculator is currently unavailable for download in the Microsoft Store. The `.msixbundle` file in this repository can be used to sideload the app for now. This may require installing the certificate in the 'Trusted Root Certification Authorities' store for the Local Machine (which can be done by right-clicking on the file, going to 'Properties', and then to 'Digital Signatures').
